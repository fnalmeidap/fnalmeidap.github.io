Hello, I'm Felipe Pereira.
I am a student of B.Sc of Computer Engineering and a Software Engineer at a payments company. I enjoy tackleling projects that challenge me learn and implement things that i have not used or learned yet. My main areas of knowldge are distributed systems, microservices and autonomous agents. 

I have mainly designed and implemented microservices in Kotlin and C#, and worked extensively with API Gateways. I do my best to write code for people and not for computers and strongly believe that software and technology are the best tools for humans to create great things and do good. 

> ##### I believe that software empowers me to express who I am and help others.

Also, I'm a member of [Rob√¥CIn](https://robocin.com.br/), a robotics group from the Informatics Centre of Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (CIn - UFPE), in Brazil. There I did extensive work in numerous areas from Data Analysis to Shellscripting to Autonomous Agents development and Research.
