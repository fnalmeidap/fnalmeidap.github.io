              <p>
                I am currently studying <b id="ht">Computer Engineering</b> at
                the Informatics Centre of Pernambuco's Federal University{" "}
                <b id="ht">(CIn - UFPE)</b>. I started this journey in august
                2018 and i intend to be graduated by the end of 2023. Besides
                studying advanced calculus and theoretical informatics i do{" "}
                <b id="ht">research</b> in two different projects. The first one
                is the wonderful <b id="ht">Rob√¥CIn</b> team! We participate of
                robotics competitions and to improve our results on them we have
                to research and develop the things we tested and found; this is
                a activity i'm very fond of and the team is composed of great
                great people. As a team, we attend to 4 different categories:
                Line Follower, Very Small Size Soccer (VSS), Small Size Soccer
                League (SSL), 2D Simulation (2D SIM); i work here ^^. There my
                research is about <b id="ht">Data Analysis</b> of the matches we
                play and <b id="ht">Software Engineering</b> to develop systems
                able to analyze these matches since it's conception; that means
                to design it's resposibilities, behaviours, architecture and
                implement them. Besides that i also research about Data Analysis
                through <b id="ht">PIBIC</b> which is a initiative to aid
                undergraduate students in their research. My current project is
                supported by <b id="ht">CNPq</b> which is also related to Data
                Analysis of the 2D SIM games.
